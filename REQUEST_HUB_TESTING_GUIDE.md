# Request Hub - Testing Guide

## Prerequisites
1. Database migration must be run first
2. User must be logged in to create hubs
3. User must be a member of the workspace

## Running the Migration

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to: **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
4. Click **"New Query"**
5. Copy the entire contents of `docs/migrations/004_create_request_hubs.sql`
6. Paste into the query editor
7. Click **"Run"** or press `Cmd+Enter`
8. Verify success message appears

### Option 2: Supabase CLI
```bash
# Install Supabase CLI if not already installed
npm install -g supabase

# Link to your project (one-time setup)
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF

# Run the migration
supabase db push docs/migrations/004_create_request_hubs.sql
```

### Verify Migration Success
Run this query in SQL Editor to verify tables exist:
```sql
SELECT 
  table_name, 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = t.table_name) as column_count
FROM information_schema.tables t
WHERE table_name IN ('request_hubs', 'request_hub_tabs');
```

Expected output:
```
table_name          | column_count
--------------------+-------------
request_hubs        | 9
request_hub_tabs    | 10
```

## Testing the UI

### 1. Access Request Hubs Module
**Method A: Via Quick Actions**
1. Open any workspace
2. You should see "Request Hubs" card in Overview
3. Click the card
4. Request Hub list page opens in new tab

**Method B: Via Module Palette**
1. Press `Cmd+P` (or `Ctrl+P` on Windows)
2. Type "Request Hubs"
3. Press Enter
4. Request Hub list page opens

**Method C: Direct URL**
1. Navigate to: `/workspace/{workspaceId}/request-hubs`
2. Replace `{workspaceId}` with your actual workspace ID

### 2. Create Your First Hub
1. On the Request Hub list page, click **"Create Hub"** button
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Hub Name**: "IT Support Requests" (or any name)
   - **URL Slug**: Auto-generated from name (e.g., "it-support-requests")
   - **Description**: Optional (e.g., "Manage IT support tickets")
3. Click **"Create Hub"**
4. Wait for success (hub card should appear)

**What happens behind the scenes:**
- Creates hub record in `request_hubs` table
- Creates 3 default tabs:
  1. Dashboard (type: dashboard)
  2. My Requests (type: my-requests)
  3. New Request (type: new-request)
- Tabs created in `request_hub_tabs` table

### 3. Verify Hub Creation
**Check in UI:**
- Hub card appears in grid
- Shows hub name, slug (e.g., /it-support-requests)
- Shows "3 tabs" count
- Status badge shows "Active"

**Check in Database:**
```sql
-- List all hubs
SELECT id, name, slug, is_active, 
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM request_hub_tabs WHERE hub_id = request_hubs.id) as tab_count
FROM request_hubs;

-- List tabs for a hub
SELECT name, type, position, is_visible 
FROM request_hub_tabs 
WHERE hub_id = 'YOUR_HUB_ID'
ORDER BY position;
```

### 4. Test Hub Actions

**Open Hub (TODO: Not yet implemented)**
- Click on hub card
- Currently logs to console: "Opening hub: {...}"
- Future: Will navigate to hub viewer page

**Settings (TODO: Not yet implemented)**
- Click settings icon (gear)
- Currently logs to console: "Settings for {...}"
- Future: Will open hub builder/editor

**Delete Hub**
1. Click delete icon (trash can) on hub card
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. Shows hub name: "Are you sure you want to delete..."
4. Click **"Delete Hub"** to confirm
5. Hub card removed from grid
6. Database: Hub's `is_active` set to `false` (soft delete)

### 5. Test Empty State
1. Delete all hubs (or start fresh)
2. Visit Request Hub list page
3. Should see:
   - Empty folder icon
   - "No Request Hubs Yet" heading
   - Description text
   - "Create Your First Hub" button
4. Click button â†’ Opens create dialog

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Failed to load request hubs"
**Causes:**
- Migration not run
- User not authenticated
- User not a workspace member

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for error details
2. Verify migration ran successfully:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM request_hubs LIMIT 1;
   ```
3. Verify user is logged in:
   - Check for auth token in localStorage
   - Try logging out and back in
4. Verify workspace membership:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM workspace_members WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
   ```

### Issue: "Failed to create request hub"
**Causes:**
- User not authenticated
- User not admin/editor role
- Duplicate slug in workspace
- RLS policy blocking

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for specific error
2. Verify user role:
   ```sql
   SELECT role FROM workspace_members 
   WHERE workspace_id = 'YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID' 
   AND user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
   ```
3. Try different hub slug
4. Verify RLS policies are enabled:
   ```sql
   SELECT tablename, policyname, cmd 
   FROM pg_policies 
   WHERE tablename IN ('request_hubs', 'request_hub_tabs');
   ```

### Issue: "Property 'created_by' is missing" (TypeScript)
**Cause:** Old cached build

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clear Next.js cache and rebuild
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### Issue: Tabs not created after hub creation
**Cause:** API error during tab creation

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for error
2. Manually verify hub was created:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM request_hubs ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
   ```
3. Check if tabs exist:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM request_hub_tabs WHERE hub_id = 'YOUR_HUB_ID';
   ```
4. If hub created but no tabs, manually create them (or delete and recreate hub)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Migration runs successfully

- [ ] Settings button exists (logs to console)
- [ ] Delete button exists
- [ ] Delete confirmation dialog works
- [ ] Hub soft-deletes (disappears from list)
- [ ] Database verification queries work

## Next Steps After Testing

### Phase 2: Build Hub Viewer
- [ ] Create `RequestHubViewer.tsx` component
- [ ] Implement tab navigation (similar to workspace tabs)
- [ ] Render tabs dynamically based on type
- [ ] Add routing: `/w/{slug}/hub/{hubSlug}`
- [ ] Update `handleOpenHub()` in list page

### Phase 3: Build Tab Renderers
- [ ] DashboardTab: Render metrics and charts
- [ ] MyRequestsTab: Show user's requests (filtered)
- [ ] NewRequestTab: Form type picker + submission
- [ ] ApprovalsTab: Approval queue for managers
- [ ] AllRequestsTab: Admin view of all requests
- [ ] AnalyticsTab: Charts and insights
- [ ] CustomTab: Custom table view

### Phase 4: Build Hub Builder/Editor
- [ ] Hub settings editor (name, description, theme)
- [ ] Tab manager (add, remove, reorder, configure)
- [ ] Tab configuration UI (per type)
- [ ] Form builder for request forms
- [ ] Workflow builder for approvals

## Database Cleanup (if needed)

```sql
-- Delete all test hubs (soft delete)
UPDATE request_hubs SET is_active = false;

-- Hard delete all data (careful!)
DELETE FROM request_hub_tabs;
DELETE FROM request_hubs;

-- Drop tables (if you need to rerun migration)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS request_hub_tabs;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS request_hubs;
```

## Success Criteria

âœ… Migration creates tables successfully
âœ… List page loads without errors
âœ… Can create new hub with default tabs
âœ… Hub appears in list immediately
âœ… Tab count displays correctly
âœ… Can delete hub (soft delete)
âœ… Empty state works when no hubs
âœ… All TypeScript types compile
âœ… No console errors during normal flow

You're ready to start building the hub viewer and tab renderers! ðŸŽ‰
