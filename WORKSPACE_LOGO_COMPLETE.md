## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Upload Flow
```typescript
1. User selects image file
   ↓
2. Validate file type and size
   ↓
3. Generate unique filename: workspace_id_timestamp.ext
   ↓
4. Upload to Supabase Storage: workspace-assets/workspace-logos/
   ↓
5. Get public URL from storage
   ↓
6. Delete old logo from storage (if exists)
   ↓
7. Update logoUrl state
   ↓
8. User clicks Save → Update database
```

### Storage Configuration
- **Bucket:** `workspace-assets` (public)
- **Folder:** `workspace-logos/`
- **File naming:** `{workspace_id}_{timestamp}.{ext}`
- **Max size:** 2MB
- **Types:** image/*

### API Integration
```typescript
// Upload
const { data } = await supabase.storage
  .from('workspace-assets')
  .upload(filePath, file)

// Get public URL
const { data: { publicUrl } } = supabase.storage
  .from('workspace-assets')
  .getPublicUrl(filePath)

// Delete
await supabase.storage
  .from('workspace-assets')
  .remove([oldPath])
```

## 📋 Setup Required

### 1. Run Database Migration
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
ALTER TABLE workspaces 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS logo_url TEXT;
```

### 2. Create Storage Bucket
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage
2. Create bucket: `workspace-assets`
3. Make it **Public**

### 3. Set Up Storage Policies
```sql
-- Upload policy
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload workspace logos"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'workspace-assets' 
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = 'workspace-logos'
);

-- Update policy
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can update workspace logos"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'workspace-assets' 
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = 'workspace-logos'
);

-- Delete policy
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can delete workspace logos"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'workspace-assets' 
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = 'workspace-logos'
);

-- Public read
CREATE POLICY "Public read access for workspace assets"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'workspace-assets');
```

See `WORKSPACE_LOGO_STORAGE_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions.

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run database migration to add logo_url column
- [ ] Create workspace-assets storage bucket in Supabase
- [ ] Set up storage policies
- [ ] Open workspace settings modal (Profile → Settings)
- [ ] Upload a logo (PNG, JPG, or GIF)
- [ ] Verify logo appears in preview
- [ ] Click Save and verify logo persists
- [ ] Verify logo appears in workspace switcher
- [ ] Upload a different logo (test replacement)
- [ ] Verify old logo is deleted from storage
- [ ] Test Remove Logo button
- [ ] Verify file validation (size, type)
- [ ] Test with images > 2MB (should fail)
- [ ] Test with non-image files (should fail)

## 🎨 User Experience

### Access
1. Click profile icon (top-right)
2. Click "Settings" in dropdown
3. Modal opens with current workspace settings

### Upload Logo
1. Click "Upload Logo" button
2. Select image file (PNG, JPG, or GIF)
3. Image validates and uploads to Supabase Storage

## 🔒 Security

- ✅ RLS policies enforce authenticated access
- ✅ File type validation prevents malicious uploads
- ✅ File size limit prevents storage abuse
- ✅ Public read access for logo display
- ✅ User can only modify workspaces they have access to

## 📊 Database Schema Update

```sql
ALTER TABLE workspaces 
ADD COLUMN logo_url TEXT;
```

This column stores the public URL of the logo from Supabase Storage.

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

1. **Database:** Run migration in Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Storage:** Create bucket and policies via dashboard
3. **Frontend:** Already deployed with this commit
4. **No environment variables needed** - uses existing Supabase config
